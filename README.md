_I will give a brief summary of some of the problems I spotted and how I addressed them.  I might now have listed everything here I fixed quite a bit while working on the main principals_

# Analysis

_After the discussion I refactored the application even more to get it to a much better state, modules split into seperate files, 
controllers refactored and added, logging service implemented, organogram tree implemented, ui templates added to further reduce 
duplication._

I went for a Unordered list <ul> for the organogram as time was a bit of a problem this time around.
